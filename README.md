# Risqué Rebecca — Premium Website & AI Concierge

The current build is the Phase 6 editorial demo: Rebecca-first, responsive, privacy-conscious and built from her approved public website content and media.

## Public routes

- `/` — premium homepage
- `/about` — profile and personality
- `/rates` — current Singapore consideration
- `/travel` — touring and fly-me-to-you guidance
- `/date-ideas` — public date inspiration, wishlist direction and the private-list handoff
- `/gallery` — curated gallery hub
- `/professional` — complete 67-photo professional portrait archive
- `/selfies-of-risquerebecca` — complete 44-photo candid archive
- `/etiquette` — screening, deposits, privacy and policies
- `/reviews` — selected public testimonials
- `/contact` — privacy-first enquiry builder

## Rebecca’s Concierge

The concierge uses a lightweight local RAG pipeline:

1. `lib/rebecca-rag.js` stores approved public knowledge as small topic chunks.
2. Each visitor question retrieves only the most relevant chunks.
3. High-risk factual and privacy questions are handled by deterministic guardrails first.
4. Broader questions send the retrieved context to Groq.
5. If Groq is unavailable or has no usable API credit, grounded deterministic fallback answers remain available.

The default dynamic model is `openai/gpt-oss-20b` with reasoning disabled for speed and cost control. Set `GROQ_MODEL` to override it.

### Required Vercel environment variable

- `GROQ_API_KEY` — Groq API key used by `/api/chat`
- `GROQ_MODEL` — optional model override; defaults to `openai/gpt-oss-20b`

Without `GROQ_API_KEY`, the concierge still works for core public topics through the grounded fallback, but broader RAG-generated answers will not call Groq.

### RAG privacy boundary

The retrieval store contains Rebecca’s useful **public** knowledge: profile, interests, rates, travel, FMTY, screening, deposits, cancellations, etiquette, public date ideas, wishlist preferences, food/wine tastes, contact information, public FAQs and the photo-only gallery inventory.

The locked private Date Ideas venue list is deliberately excluded. The concierge must not reveal, guess or reconstruct it.

### Privacy rules

- Do not send ID documents, employer documents, financial information, passwords or other sensitive screening material to the concierge.
- Concierge history remains in the browser and is not replayed as trusted server context.
- Groq Responses requests use `store: false`.
- The enquiry builder does not submit visitor data to a database; it formats the enquiry locally for Rebecca’s verified channels.

## Main edit locations

- Content and page layout: each `.html` page
- Shared design system: `styles.css`
- Navigation, enquiry builder and concierge UI: `script.js`
- RAG knowledge + retrieval: `lib/rebecca-rag.js`
- Concierge server endpoint: `api/chat.js`
- Vercel routing/security settings: `vercel.json`

## Production readiness

GitHub `main` is connected to Vercel. Production deployment is triggered by the eventual Phase 6 merge.

- Legacy paths with direct equivalents are either preserved as real pages or permanently redirected.
- `/professional` and `/selfies-of-risquerebecca` are preserved as real pages.
- CSP and baseline security headers are configured in `vercel.json`.
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, canonical URLs and homepage structured data are prepared for the review domain.
- At custom-domain cutover, replace review-domain canonical/OG/sitemap/structured-data URLs with `https://www.risquerebecca.com`.
- See `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` for the final cutover sequence.
